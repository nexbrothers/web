The startup playbook says keep your ideas secret. Guard your roadmap. Never show your hand.

We're doing the opposite.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public means sharing our journey openly — the wins, the failures, the lessons. Here's why we believe it's the right approach:

### 1. Accountability

When you share your goals publicly, you're more likely to follow through. We've committed to shipping Playro, and our community holds us to it.

### 2. Faster Feedback

Instead of building in isolation for months, we share early concepts and get real user feedback. This saves us from costly pivots later.

### 3. Trust

Users trust companies that are transparent. By showing our work, we build relationships with people who believe in what we're creating.

## What We're Sharing

Moving forward, you can expect:

- **Weekly updates** on what we're building
- **Technical deep-dives** into problems we've solved
- **Honest post-mortems** when things go wrong
- **Open discussions** about product decisions

## Join the Journey

This blog is our first step toward building in public. We'll share everything here — the code, the design decisions, the mistakes.

If you're building something too, we'd love to connect. Drop us a line at [hello@nexbrothers.com](mailto:hello@nexbrothers.com).

The journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single commit. Let's build something great together.
