Running a cricket tournament shouldn't require a spreadsheet PhD. Yet for years, organizers have struggled with manual scorekeeping, confusing point calculations, and the chaos of managing multiple teams across complex formats.

That's exactly why we built **Playro**.

## The Problem

Every cricket enthusiast has experienced the frustration:

- **Manual scorecards** getting lost or damaged
- **Points tables** that take hours to calculate
- **No live updates** for players and fans
- **Statistics scattered** across notebooks and WhatsApp groups

We knew there had to be a better way.

## Our Solution

Playro is designed from the ground up to handle everything a tournament organizer needs:

### Real-Time Scoring

Score matches live from your phone. Every run, wicket, and extra is instantly reflected across the tournament.

```
Match: Tigers vs Lions
Overs: 12.4/20
Score: 98/3
Required: 47 runs from 44 balls
```

### Automatic Standings

No more manual calculations. Playro automatically updates points tables based on your tournament format — whether it's a league, knockout, or super over.

### Beautiful Statistics

Players can track their performance across matches:

- Batting average and strike rate
- Bowling economy and wickets
- Fielding contributions

## What's Next?

Playro is currently in development, and we're excited to share it with you soon. Sign up for early access at [nexbrothers.com/playro](https://nexbrothers.com/playro).
